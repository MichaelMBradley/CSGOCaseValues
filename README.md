# CSGOCaseValues
 Estimating expected value of each case in CSGO, using data scraped from CSGOStash.

### Roadmap
1. Output currently indicates that opening cases is profitable. This is almost certainly false. Identify and fix logic errors.
2. Begin saving historical price data.
3. Use simpler methods of data collection. (e.g. some API instead of web scraping)
